## Description
>b"Yesterday, a thunderstorm happened when I developed this website and suddenly my laptop went off due to big thunder. But worry not, nano technology can save it all and thankfully Ive finished it on time. Good luck on hacking this not so secure website! \r\n\r\nBackup: http://103.167.136.123:3850\r\n\r\nAuthor: maskirovka#5610"

**Hint**
* Have you found the secret function that I\ve implemented for this website? Maybe it could be use as a path to become "one" with the system. And beware of the invisible wall that protect the internal system. One more thing, "fast" and "understanding" is all you needed. Good luck!
