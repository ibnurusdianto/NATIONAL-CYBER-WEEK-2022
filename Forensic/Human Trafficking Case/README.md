## Description
>b"`Takumi Ozawa` is a man who works for an illegal human trafficking community in Japan and US. He has just been caught by the local\r\npolice due to an illegal transaction that was happened in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Forensics Unit Policeman, Jean Tirstan informed that the evidence that they got is only a phone from Takumi himself so  he imaged the phone, parsed out some important evidence that will likely be the digital artifact for a proof in a courtroom.\r\n\r\nCan you help us by clarifying the questions related to the evidences?\r\n\r\nThere are **12** questions that you need to answer.\r\nIf you are worried that one of the question is either correct or incorrect, theres an `nc` service which will tell you if youre in the correct path:\r\n\r\n**nc 103.167.136.75 5377**\r\n\r\nAlternative:\r\n\r\n**nc 103.167.136.123 5377**\r\n\r\nDownload File [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mih6PaVFA4mvmx2Ki0ApYk7h1lEFIa7B/view?usp=share_link)\r\n\r\nAuthor: aseng#2055"

**Hint**
* Perhaps this repository can assist your investigation:\nhttps://github.com/abrignoni/ALEAPP\n* If you manage to find the second application chat/channel, there are conversations that might help you uncover the evidence of the boss and Takumi.\n\nFun fact, the second apps will auto-delete the last character of each message from the user. This is intended by the behaviour of the second apps architecture design.\n\nNote that, all of the questions regarding the timestamps are in UTC format. Note that most of the apps timestamp are in UTC+7 ~, so probably you need to substract by 7-hours, or not (since some also in UTC by default).\n
